Spring boot Microservices logging with Graylog

# Overview
Graylog is a powerful platform that allows for easy log management of both structured and unstructured data along with debugging applications. It is based on Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and Scala. Graylog has a main server, which receives data from its clients installed on different servers, and a web interface, which visualizes the data and allows to work with logs aggregated by the main server.
